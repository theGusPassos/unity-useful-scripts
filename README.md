Useful scripts that I use in multiple unity projects

## How to add to a unity project

in your project's folder run:
`git submodule add https://github.com/theGusPassos/unity-useful-scripts.git .\Packages\unity-useful-scripts`

this will clone this repo in your Packages folder, you'll then be able to use the scripts in your project and open them in VS with intellisense activated
